## 🔑 Why This Version Works Better
- **Sapa & Ha Long separated**: You return to Hanoi first → no crazy Sapa → Ha Long direct marathon.  
- **Cruise flexibility**: Still enjoy 1 night in Ha Long Bay without needing Christmas alignment.  
- **Time & cost saving**:  
  - Only **2 domestic flights** (Hanoi → Da Nang, Da Nang → HCMC).  
  - Less risk of delays from tight transfers.  
- **Better rest balance**: You get downtime in Hanoi, Hội An, and cruise.
